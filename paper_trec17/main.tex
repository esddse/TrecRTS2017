In this paper, we describe our approaches and corresponding results in the Real-Time Summarization(RTS) track at the 2017 Text Retrieval Conference(TREC).
The main idea is to build a two-stage filter system for both scenario A and B. 
In the first stage, tweets are filtered according to its relevance score to a particular topic,
while in the second stage, they are filtered according to its novelty score to previous submitted tweets.
We tried several approaches to model the text similarity, such as negative KL-divergence and cosine distance, as well as blending models.
Especially, in scenario A, the push notification scenario, we designed a decoupled system that can maintain high availability in order to meet the real-time requirements. 
The experiment results show that our methods reach good performance with respect to several metrics such as EG-p and nDCG-p.
