\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present our systems for TREC 2017 Real-Time Summarization Track.
We design a two-stage filtering system for both Scenario A and B, 
and utilize two kinds of text similarity model, 
language model with negative KL-divergence and IDF with cosine distance.
Pseudo relevance feedback technique is tried to do query expansion.
Particularly, a decoupled real-time system are designed for Scenario A.
Experimental results show our effectiveness and efficiency of our system in both tasks.
